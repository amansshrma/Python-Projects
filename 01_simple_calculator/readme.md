# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator project written in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The program handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides error messages accordingly.

## Features

- Accepts two integer inputs from the user.
- Supports four arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
- Handles invalid inputs, such as non-integer values.
- Prevents division by zero.
- Uses Python 3.10+ `match` statement for operation selection.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Choose the operation by pressing one of the following keys: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
5. The result will be displayed on the screen.
6. If invalid input is entered or an invalid operation is selected, an appropriate error message will appear.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
What kind of operation do you want to perform?
Press + for Addition
Press - for Subtraction
Press * for Multiplication
Press / for Division

+
Your calculated value of 10 + 5 is: 15
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (due to usage of the `match` statement)
